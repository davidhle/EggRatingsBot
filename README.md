# Egg Rating Donald Trump's Tweets

Link to Twitter Account: https://twitter.com/TrumpEggRatings

My bot checks for incoming tweets from @realDonaldTrump and gives that tweet
an "Egg Rating" which is dependent on things such as using caps, exclamatinon
points, or question marks, mentioning Clinton or ObamaCare, or saying things
like "fake" or "lie/lies" and posts a picture of that certain egg based off
of its egg rating.

My purpose in creating this bot is to mimick/simulate those types of people
who start to use a new phrase (maybe they invented it themselves) or saying
to describe someone or something. In this case, it's something that I would
not be surprised if I started doing, because I really like eggs. My main
purpose for this bot was for it to be entertaining and nonsensical.

For example of people who invent a new type of slang:
"Trump is being really hard boiled on twitter lately"
"Have you seen Trump's latest tweet? It is SO scrambled!"
